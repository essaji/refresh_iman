Humans are impatient, hasty, weak, stingy and irritable, yet Allah(subhana wa ta’ala) insisted on buying our faulty earthly lives in exchange for infinite happiness. Our bargain is in the Quran: “God has bought of the believers their lives and their possessions, promising them paradise in return… a promise which in truth He has willed upon Himself… And who could be more faithful to his covenant than God?

Make a ratio of your time on earth compared to your time in the akhira, it would be 100 years: trillions of years. It doesn't matter how long you live because any number when compared to infinity (life in Jannat), becomes zero. So we essentially got Jannah for free. That is why Rasul Allah (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) said that if a person were to be dragged on his face from the moment that he was born to the time that he dies, he would consider that insignificant on the Day of Judgment.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\" \/\u003E\u003Cbr style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\" \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\"\u003E“O Allah, Make Your love the most beloved thing to me of all loves, and make my fear of you be the most fearful thing to me of all fears.

The man then related what he had heard and seen, and inquired from the owner of the farm what was special about him that would explain all of this. Given the reason for the inquiry, the owner explained that he would plant his farm and then split the harvest into three equal parts.

The importance of consistency in doing good deeds: The man was giving one third of his earnings as sadaqa on a regular basis. This is why Allah (subhana wa ta’ala) was sending rain especially for him.

The importance of sadaqa: Allah (subhana wa ta’ala) was sending rizk to this man (in the form of rain) because of his sadaqa. Allah (subhana wa ta’ala), therefore, used him as a channel to provide for the needy. Money is a trial from Allah (subhana wa ta'ala), it is not a sign of a person’s righteousness. Some of the prophets of Allah were poor and some of the enemies of Allah (subhana wa ta’ala) were rich.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\" \/\u003E\u003Cbr style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\" \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; line-height: 18px;\"\u003EAllah's reward is the everlasting, beautiful Jannah, which contains only happiness and delight. Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) says that if the significance of this world was even as much as the wing of a mosquito in His eyes, He would not give those who deny Him even a sip of water to drink.

They say that it is the non-Muslims who must be the beloved of Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) as they have been bestowed with His favours. It is implied that the non-Muslims should now be our role models. Rasul Allah (sal Allahu alaihi wasallam) states in this hadith, as does Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) in the Quran, that whatever qualities the non-Muslims have, they will be recompensed for them in this world, since they have no share in the Hereafter.

What they are getting in this life is in no ways any kind of reward. Reward and punishment is for the next, never-ending life. This life is the examination hall. If a teacher has been teaching her students all year that 2+2=4 and she notices some students writing 2+2=6, she will not correct them during the exam. It is when they get their reports that they will be rewarded or face the consequences for their lack of effort.

No matter how hardworking, honest, scientifically advanced, or punctual Muslims become, their socieites will not prosper if eeman and the implementation of Islam\/Shariah are missing. This is because Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) holds Muslims to a higher standard. A student of Masters level and a PhD student may both be taking the same Chemistry course, but for the Masters student the 'A' may be given at 80% while for the PhD student, obtaining 90% or above will get him\/her the same grade.
